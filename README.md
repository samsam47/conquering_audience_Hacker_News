This project aims to determine what are the basics key to success when you post on a social network tech-oriented.

What is the best to generate answers : show_posts or ask_posts ?
What time slot should you prefer to post ?

To that end, I will analyse 20,000 different posts from Hacker News social network.

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. 
 is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.
